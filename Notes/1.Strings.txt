*** Strings ***

Because most programs define and gather some sort of data, and then do something
useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. The first data
type we'll look at is the sting. Stings are quite simple at first glance, but
you can use them in many different ways.
a string simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered
a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your string
like this:
	"This is a string"
	'This is also a string.'

--- Changing case in a string with methods ---

One of the simplest tasks you can do with strings is change the case of the 
words in a string.

	name "ada lovelace"
	print(name.title())

	>>> Ada Lovelace

In this example, the lowercase string "ada lovelace" is stored in the variable
name. The method title() appears after the variable in the print() statement.
A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (.)
after name in name.title() tells Python to make the tittle() method act on the
variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods
often need additional information to do their work.

--- Combining or concatenating strings ---

It's often useful to combine strings. For example, you might want to store a
first name and a last name in separate variables, and then combine them when you
want to display someone's full name:

	first_name = "ada"
	last_name = "lovelace"
	full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
	message = "Hello, " + full_name.title() + "!"

	print(message)

	>>> Hello, Ada Lovelace!

This method of combining strings is called concatenation. You can use 
concatenation to compose complete messages using the information you've 
stored in a variable.
