*** Naming and using variables ***

When you're using variables in python, you need to adhere to a few rules and
guidelines. Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guidelines 
just helpyou write code that's easier to read and understand. Be sure to keep 
the following variable rules in mind:
	- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
	They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a numberr.
	For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.
	- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscorers can be used
	to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works
	, but greeting message will cause errors.
	- Avoid using Pytthon keywords and function names as carriables names;
	that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular pro-
	grammatic purpose, such as the word print.
	-Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is
	better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_lenght is 
	better than length_of_persons_name.
	- Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter
	O because the could be confused with tthe unmbers 1 and 0.
