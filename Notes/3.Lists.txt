*** Lists ***

A list is a collection of items in a particular order. you can make a list that
includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0-9, or the names of all
the people in your family.

In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the
list are separated by commas. Here's a simple example of a list that contains
a few kinds oof bicycles:

	bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
	print(bicycles)

	>>> ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']

--- Accesing elements in a list ---

Lists are ordered collections, so ypu can access any element in a list by
telling Python he position, or index, of the item desired.

	bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
        print(bicycles[0])

	>>> trek

Python has a special syntax for accessing tthe las element in a list. By asking
for the item at index -1, Python always returns tthe las item in the list:

	bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
        print(bicycles[-1])

        >>> specialized

The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the listt, the index -3
returns the third itetm from the end, and so forth.
